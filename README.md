## How Nyx Works (For Everyone)

You don’t need to be a tech wizard or download anything. Just open the website and:

1. **Find a User:** See who’s online and ready to help.
2. **Check Skills:** Look for someone who knows the thing you want help with (like fixing a coding bug or solving a math problem).
3. **Start a Sync:** Click to jump into a quick video or chat with them.
4. **Send a Spark:** If they helped you, send a little “Spark” to say thanks and boost their rep.

## Communities (Nodes)

Nyx is made up of different **Nodes** these are like communities or groups, kind of like subreddits. You can join a Node to find people who share your interests or skills.
